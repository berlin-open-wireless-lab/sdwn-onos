ONOS : Open Network Operating System
====================================

### SDWN extension
This version of ONOS has diverged from the upstream version. This is due to compatibility issues related to [loxigen](https://github.com/floodlight/loxigen) that had to be adressed
to use ONOS for SDWN during Google Summer of Code 2017.
We are working on resolving them to merge with upstream ONOS.
